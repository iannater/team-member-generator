  For this project we built a node app that would allow a Manager to fill in their info through various prompted questions. Once they are done filling out their questions they aer able to fill in their employee info. They can choose from a two types of employees either interns or engineers. Once they have completed their full list of employees they will select that they are done adding employees and can then generate an HTML page with their team members.
