  For this project we built a node app that would allow a Manager to fill in their info through various prompted questions. Once they are done filling out their questions they aer able to fill in their employee info. They can choose from a two types of employees either interns or engineers. Once they have completed their full list of employees they will select that they are done adding employees and can then generate an HTML page with their team members.

  ## Installation
  npm i

  ## Usage
  1. In your terminal cd into the Develop folder that contains the app.js file.
  2. Run the app file using node (node app.js)
  3. You will then answer a series of questions related to the manager for the team. The manager will be created first since the employees will be under the manager.
  4. Once you complete the manager questions you will be able to select employees to add. There will be two options either intern or engineer. You can go through and add as many employees as you would like.
  5. Once you are complete you will select "I am done adding employees". Once that option is selected you will see a folder be created called outputs. Inside of that folder will be an team.html file that will contain all of your team members.
